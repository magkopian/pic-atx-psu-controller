Description:
============

This is the source code of the firmware for the controller board of the bench power supply I made out of an old ATX PSU. If you want to learn how to make one yourself check out the [instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/Convert-an-ATX-PSU-Into-a-Bench-PSU-that-Measures-/) I made.

To compile the code you are going to need the [MPLAB X IDE](http://www.microchip.com/pagehandler/en-us/family/mplabx/) and the [XC8](http://www.microchip.com/pagehandler/en_us/devtools/mplabxc/) compiler.
